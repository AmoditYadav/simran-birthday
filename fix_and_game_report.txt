FIX AND GAME IMPLEMENTATION REPORT
==================================

1. DIAGNOSIS (CTA BUTTON)
-------------------------
- ROOT CAUSE: Critical HTML regression. The "Carousel" section's internal structure (track, slides) was accidentally deleted in a previous step.
- EFFECT: The `main.js` script crashed at `initCarousel()` because it could not find `.carousel-track`. This crash occurred *before* `initInteractions()`, so the CTA button never got its click listener.
- FIX: 
  1. Restored the full Carousel HTML structure (without captions, as originally requested).
  2. Added `z-index: 20` to `.hero-card` in CSS to enforce reliable clicking over the canvas.

2. NEW FEATURE: "CATCH THE HEARTS"
----------------------------------
- Added a new section: `<section id="game-section">`.
- Logic: Spawns floating 💜 elements.
- Interaction: 
  - Click/Tap to pop hearts.
  - Score counter updates real-time.
  - Win Condition: Collect 5 hearts to reveal a hidden romantic message.
- Mobile Support: Added `touchstart` listeners and disabled scrolling on game container touch to prevent swipes from interfering.

3. VERIFICATION (SELF-TEST)
---------------------------
Browser Console Logs:
- [PASS] CTA Integrity Check
- [PASS] Game Container Check

4. NEXT STEPS
-------------
- No further action required.
- The site is ready to deploy.
- Changes are local; run `git push` to go live.
