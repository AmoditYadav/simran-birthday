HILL CLIMB GAME UPGRADE REPORT
==============================

1. VISUAL UPGRADES
------------------
- **Car Rendering**: Now drawn with separate chassis, cabin, and rotating wheels.
- **Suspension**: Added vertical bounce (sine wave based on velocity) for "floaty" feel.
- **Terrain**: Implemented multi-layered sine wave generation for "rolling hills" effect.
- **Parallax**: Added background hill layer moving at 30% speed for depth.
- **Environment**: 
  - Dynamic Sky Gradient (Day -> Night cycle based on distance).
  - Procedural Stars appear at night.

2. PHYSICS & FEEL
-----------------
- **Gravity**: Set to 0.1 (Gentle).
- **Acceleration**: 0.05 / Friction: 0.02 (Smooth ramp).
- **Rotation**: 
  - Calculated based on 40px forward lookahead.
  - Damped to prevent jitter.
  - Clamped to +/- 0.6 radians to prevent flipping.
- **Mobile Controls**:
  - `touchstart` + `mousedown` triggers acceleration.
  - `touchend` + `mouseup` triggers coasting.
  - Spacebar support added for desktop.

3. HEART SYSTEM (TIERED)
------------------------
- **Normal Heart (❤️)**: Value 1. Common.
- **Big Heart (💜)**: Value 5. Chance > 75%.
- **Gold Heart (💛)**: Value 10. Chance > 92%.
- **Spawning**: Continuous stream ahead of the player (infinite generation).

4. PROGRESSION
--------------
- **Milestones**: 10, 25, 50, 100, 200 Hearts.
- **Feedback**:
  - Visual particle explosion on collection.
  - "Woo! N Hearts!" flash message on milestones.
  - Sky changes color as you drive further.

5. INTEGRITY CHECK
------------------
- [x] Index.html restored (Tabs/Footer visible).
- [x] Mobile events scoped to game container.
- [x] No external physics libraries used.
- [x] Performance: Uses requestAnimationFrame, objects culled when off-screen.

STATUS: UPGRADE DEPLOYED & STABLE.
